Periodic Table of the elements
===============================

## This Periodic Table was developed to be:

* Portable - A single file with no graphics or other external resources.
* Lean - Focused on the information. Only the most minimal HTML and CSS is added.
* Printable - Tested to look great in most printers in landscape orientation
* HTML5 valid
* Readable - Source code formatted to be nearly as easy to read as the rendered version.
